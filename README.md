**Project Name** - Analyzing Host Immune Response to Campylobacter jejuni: A Bioinformatics Approach to Biomarker and Drug Target Identification


**Abstract** - Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, impacting millions annually. This project identified key proteins involved in the host response using the GEO database which were further analysed using the STRING database to map interactions among 20 critical proteins. Cross-referencing of antibiotics from GeneCards with identified proteins highlighted the ongoing challenge of antibiotic resistance. The research also identified essential biomarkers through random forest analysis in R, comparing the accuracy of top 10 proteins from the initial GEO/STRING list and supplementary data. The findings underscore the value of targeting host response proteins and bacterial factors to develop novel treatments, supporting the use of Azithromycin and Erythromycin and exploring Metronidazole for enhanced therapeutic strategies.

**Conclusion** - This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the molecular responses to Campylobacter jejuni infection and identifies potential therapeutic targets for treatment. The use of databases such as GEO and STRING facilitated the identification of key proteins and their interactions, providing a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen relationship
Erythromycin and Azithromycin continues to be an effective treatment option, while metronidazole presents an alternative that could be used in combination therapies to combat resistant strains
The Machine Learning results show partial overlap with the findings of the paperâ€™s statistical analysis, highlighting some alignment with the two approaches.
